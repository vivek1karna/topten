## JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY ##

**“What are we aiming at?”**

That is the issue our first president, Daniel Coit Gilman, asked at his initiation in 1876. What is this place about, precisely? His reply: "The support of research . . . what's more, the headway of individual researchers, who by their perfection will propel the sciences they seek after, and the general public where they stay." Gilman trusted that instructing and research go as one—that accomplishment in one relies on upon achievement in the other—and that a current college must do both well. He likewise trusted that sharing our insight and disclosures would improve the world a place. Following 140 years, we haven't strayed from that vision. This is still a goal for astounding, driven researchers and a world pioneer in instructing and research. Recognized teachers coach understudies in expressions of the human experience and music, humanities, social and normal sciences, building, worldwide studies, training, business, and the wellbeing callings. Those same employees, and their associates at the college's Applied Physics Laboratory, have made us the country's pioneer in government innovative work subsidizing each year since 1979. That is a fitting qualification for America's first research college, a place that reformed advanced education in America.
